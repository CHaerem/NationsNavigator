# Country Data

The `countryData.json` file holds structured information for every country used by the app. It includes names, populations, languages, flag details and more. The `metadata` section at the end records when the file was last updated and the data version.

Run `scripts/updateCountryData.py` to refresh the file from the online RestCountries API whenever you need the latest information.
