# NationsNavigator

NationsNavigator is an innovative web application that combines the power of WebLLM (Web-based Large Language Model) with interactive geographical data visualization. This project enables users to explore a world map, access detailed country information, and leverage AI to answer complex queries about nations and geography in real-time.

## Features

- Interactive world map powered by Leaflet.js
- Comprehensive country information display on click
- AI-powered query system using WebLLM for answering questions about nations and geography
- Dynamic country highlighting based on AI-generated query results

## How It Works

NationsNavigator employs a client-side Large Language Model (LLM) to process and respond to user queries about countries and geographical data. The application seamlessly integrates this AI capability with an interactive map interface, creating a unique and powerful tool for exploring and learning about nations worldwide.
